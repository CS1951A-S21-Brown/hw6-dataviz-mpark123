        <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; font-size: 14px;"> 1. For my dashboard, I represented each question provided for the Netflix dataset with an individual graph. For the first question on the number of titles per genre on Netflix, I felt that a simple bar graph would be the best option. The bar graph provided a concise way to organize and rank the number of titles for each genre. When designing the graph, if a title had mutliple genres, I decided to include them all and so certain titles contributed to more than one genre. I also decided to incorporate my interactive feature on this graph as I felt that viewing the genre breakdown by year could help the data be interpreted better. The number of genres included for each year varied and the leading genre types also varied and so by specifying the year, the data could be looked at through time. However, the data is initially presented and can be reverted back to the whole range of years possible (2010 - 2020). The second question desired a way to visualize the average runtime of movies by release year. For this, I felt that a line graph of sorts would be the best representation as it could help visualize the change in averages over time. However, since there were some years missing from the dataset, I selected a connected scatterplot where an approximate line curve was included to help depict the trend throughout the years. Each point on the plot represented a year and I decided to incorporate my tooltip on this graph. By hovering over the points, there could be more data available as a small infographic with the year and the average runtime measurement. Lastly, the last portion of my dashboard addressed a breakdown of the top director and actor pairs by the number of movies made together. For this, I needed a ranking/comparison visual of sorts and so I elected to utilize a bar graph again. I found every pair of director and actor and simply calculated the number of occurrences, or titles that they appeared in together. For titles with multiple directors, I paired each director with the whole cast individually. The graph was able to concisely organize, rank, and label the top pairs of directors and actors that appeared together in a visually appealing way.</p><br/>
        <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; font-size: 14px;"> 2. I think that D3 was helpful in many ways. I think that the biggest thing was the organizational advantage it provided. It allowed for me to organize the graphs in a structured way where the general approach could be applied to other graphs/types of graphs. I found this to be the best help when creating my visualization as the ability of D3 to translate to various types of visuals was advantageous. Similarly, I found the ability to render certain aspects of the graph prior to the inputted information to be very beneficial in general efficiency. In other words, when I was including my interactive component of my first graph, it was very helpful to be able to generate a general background/axes/layout and then have the information simply be updated by D3 when the user input changed the specified year. Lastly, D3 provided ways to simply help with the aesthetic and interpretation of the graphs. The color range was super helpful as it specified the breakdown of colors for me and would break it down appropriately for the range of values. The ability of D3 to appropriately account for variations in values and translate that to changes in the colors or theme. Along these lines, little benefits such as the tooltip helped make the information more interpretable and attractive.</p><br/>
        <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; font-size: 14px;"> 3. Conversely, I think that D3 has some faults in creating a visualization. Firstly, I do not think it is the most user friendly. I think that relative to other libraries such as Matplotlib, there is certainly a learning curve and it requires more devotion (as it involves knowledge on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS). I also think that D3 would not be the best option for very advanced visualizations. I think that in order to create large, elaborate visualizations it would require in depth work and experienced practice with D3. Along these lines, I question how D3 would handle very large datasets where the visualization requires the data points to be visualized. However, when compared to other libraries that may even build upon D3, there could be better options. Lastly, I think that D3 may not be the best option for depicting statistical information/calculations on the visualizations. I think this was evidenced as it is a little more in depth to incorporate those features. For a visualization that focuses mostly on statistical information, I think that a library such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly may be best. </p><br/>
        <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; font-size: 14px;"> 4. I think that I did a decent job in making my dashboard accessible. For the most part, I wanted to keep my visualizations as simple as possible. I felt that although there were pehaps other potential visualization options for each of the three parts, I wanted to make them simple. Thus, that is why I ended up selecting a bar graph for two of my parts as I felt that it would be the simplest visualization possible. Furthermore, I sorted my results and data so that the visualizations were aesthetically pleasing and easier to interpret. In terms of how I chose the color shading of the graphs, I chose to the best of my ability. I avoided conflicting or polar opposite colors and wanted to stick with a simple color gradient where the intensity of the color would help indicate the differences. I also wanted to label my graphs to the best of my ability. For my bar graphs, I included labels for the values of each bar to help it be more accessible. The article "A Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization" mentioned a few things that I tried to take into consideration when designing my dashboard. I attempted to clearly label my graphs, with axis titles (with units if possible) and an overall comprehensive title. I also avoided overcomplicating my color selections and wanted concise coloring as previously mentioned. The article also described to label data points directly rather than having a legend, which I attempted to do as previously mentioned. Similarly. it also mentioned to avoid hover overlays. I unfortunately compromised in my second graph as I felt that a tooltip was appropriate to help include more information on each data point rather than having a clustered graph with clustered labelings. I also wanted to avoid complex tooling as the article recommended. When I included the interactive tool, I had a small description on the potential options for the user input and left the input up to the user rather than electing for a more complex tool such as a slider for the range of years. Overall, I wanted to make my dashboard more accessible for people of various disabilities. I wanted to avoid overcomplications in presentation, interpretaion, and visuals as I believed that would help the information be more accessible to groups with corresponding disabilities. However, something that I believe I should do is include more concise text describing the visualizations. Doing so could especially aid those relying on screen readers as it would help summarize the results in a deliverable way for all. Another step I think that would be beneficial would be to break down the visualizations even further in a sense of decomposing the results into perhaps smaller graphs that would be easier to understand and interpret. By dividing the results, I would be able to include more beneficial aspects to the visualizations to be more accessible to more groups.</p><br/>
        <p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%; font-size: 14px;"> 5. One thing I touched upon doing above was providing more concise text descriptions so that those that rely on screen readers could understand the information better. However, I elected to not do so as I was admittedly unfamiliar with HTML and CSS. I felt that it would be slightly difficult to provide descriptions in a concise, yet appealing way with no knowledge on the structure of HTML and CSS. Another thing that I wish I could do was to be better with my color range selections. While I feel that the colors I selected are not polarizing nor visually unappealing, I would have liked to chosen a range of colors that would help people with color blindness in the best possible way. However, I am admittedly inept at being visually creative and so I did have trouble with narrowing down colors that were visually appealing in the first place. Another thing I think I would have perhaps avoided was the use of a hover/tooltip portion. I included it as it was a portion of the assignment but the article I discussed above mentioned not utilizing hover aspects as it is difficult to use with assisting technology.</p><br/>
